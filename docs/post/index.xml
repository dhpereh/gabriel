      <description>The raw scent of a plant, the crystal&amp;rsquo;s vital color, the animal&amp;rsquo;s spirit, are in equanimity with themselves, in equilibrium, in a state of fidelity. They are always the helpers to us men who forget the sense for and the state of being &amp;ldquo;a single action&amp;rdquo; with our entire being.
Our apparent and mechanical world clouds the sense for this residing spirit, and its own spirit is polluted with corruption. Our residing spirit is both life-giving and life-taking, it possesses both a force of destruction and a force which attempts to perpetuate new life as and by a particular virtue.</description>
