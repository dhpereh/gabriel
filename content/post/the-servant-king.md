The raw scent of a plant, the crystal's vital color, the animal's spirit, are in equanimity with themselves, in equilibrium, in a state of fidelity. They are always the helpers to us men who forget the sense for and the state of being "a single action" with our entire being.

Our apparent and mechanical world clouds the sense for this residing spirit, and its own spirit is polluted with corruption.
Our residing spirit is both life-giving and life-taking, it possesses both a force of destruction and a force which attempts to perpetuate new life as and by a particular virtue. A spirit which without its destructive element leads to tyranny and corruption, and without its particular life-giving element all falls into chaos. This spirit is the Daimon. One has to allow the expression of both aspects of the Daimon in order to set out towards what would be best expressed, or rather experienced as true beauty, grace, passion and power.

This spirit is graceful by its nature, as it is a force guided by the truth. But it envelopes and takes over the weak minded, for the weak minded attempt to suppress and enslave it for the service of a superficial and artificial perception of oneself. The strong minded adopts a life of service, with the love and care of the king who wishes the greatest for all in his kingdom and develops a vessel that is strong and great enough to allow the expression of the Daimon and the being in its entirety. The king soon finds out that he is one with his kingdom.

Inspire within you that kin spirit, which invites the fellowship between all beings, outside your boundaries of self and within them. Allow the forces of destruction to be done, but onto your own corruption and ego maddened mind, and out of the fire let a truer form emerge as the Phoenix which rises purer out of the flames

"Oh, sons and daughters of nature, you are most welcome to our fairy lands, to our huts and campfires. For they are never lonely, those who have come back home, who are of genuine intentions. Within us all, the life-force shines clear and graceful, and we are its servant-kings"

Brethrens, it is your hearts I wish to love, the heart, the Daimon which is both eternal life and mortal virtue, the spirit which is both yours and ours to hold, the force which brings all together and sets all apart.
To care for something requires also to hold it separately.
Friends, be true and I be too, for only then can our souls truly meet. We can love only the other, and we can only identify that which has identity. Identity, from latin Neuter, which translates as "The same", the same in all its parts. So is the entity which is virtuous, true. So is the being that exists in unison with its spirit, soul and mind, all in one movement.
