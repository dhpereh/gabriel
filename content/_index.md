Either we are to be shown and taught the awe inspiring beauty and power of benevolence or we will seek to serve and become the perpetrators of the destructive spiritual and material power of malevolence, dia-bolic in nature.

No one can remain outside these mighty turbalences of life, which demand the truest virtue of a man in order to battle and yet remain vital and ultimately grow.
